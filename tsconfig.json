     * TypeScript automagically loads typings from all "@types/*" packages if the "compilerOptions.types" array is not defined in
     * this file. However, if some dependencies have "@types/*" packages as their dependencies, they'll also be loaded as well.
     * As a result, TypeScript loaded "@types/node" which we don't want to use, because it allows using Node.js specific APIs that
     * are not available in the browsers.
     *
     * To avoid such issues, we defined this empty "types" to disable automatic inclusion of the "@types/*" packages.
